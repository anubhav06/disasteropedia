                <div className="answer">
                    This is a website for monitoring the disaster situation in India through Social Media posts. <br />
                    It is mainly made for the government agencies in India, like NDRF (National Disaster Relief Force) <br/>
                    <br /> Please Note: This is not an official website of/for the government. This is created by me, Anubhav, for social good, <br />
                    and can even by used by residents of India, to get updates about the disaster situation near them.

                <p className="question"> Q. How does it work ? üñ•Ô∏è </p>
                <div className="answer">
                    Any post which is shared on Social Media (currently supports Twitter only), which is about a disaster, <br />
                    gets shown here on the website, along with the media of that disaster, in real time (LIVE). <br />
                    It finds the important data from the tweets, like the location and type of disaster. <br/>
                    All this data is shown in a user friendly & organized manner, to make it easier for the authorities to monitor the situation.
